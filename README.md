## 🎮 Features

- 🔁 **Evolutionary Learning**  
  Uses genetic algorithms to evolve neural networks generation by generation.

- 🧠 **Neural Network Brain**  
  Each bird is controlled by a lightweight feedforward neural network.

- 📈 **Fitness-Based Selection**  
  Birds that perform better have a higher chance of passing on their "genes".

- 🕹️ **Built with Pygame**  
  Visualize the training process live as the birds learn to fly.
